Upgrading AIMBAT
================

Getting the latest version
--------------------------

The latest version of AIMBAT, currently version 0.1.3, is hosted on the `pysmo repository <https://github.com/pysmo>`_ on Github. We will periodically be making updates to it. 

To upgrade AIMBAT, first delete the old AIMBAT files on your computer. 

Next, download the newest version of `AIMBAT <https://github.com/pysmo/aimbat>`_ and `SAC <https://github.com/pysmo/sac>`_ from github. Now, cd into the newest AIMBAT folder and run::
	
	sudo python setup.py build --fcompiler=gfortran
	sudo python setup.py install

Also, cd into the newest SAC folder and run::
	
	sudo python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

Now, go to the `.profile` file and add the `scripts` folder in the new AIMBAT version to your path.

Possible Issues
---------------

Some users have reported errors with upgrading. If there are any problems running the updated AIMBAT, try the following:

Get the location of the python ``site-packages`` directory by typing the following into the python console::

	import site
	site.getsitepackages()

The path to the site packages directory is highlighted in the figure below.

cd into the site-packages directory and remove all the folders with the word ``pysmo`` in their names by typing::

	sudo rm -rf <psymo-folder>

Now, reinstall the new version of AIMBAT.

If this still does not work, upgrade your Python libraries as detailed in section 2.7.1 of this manual and reinstall the new verson of AIMBAT.
