* Code for AIMBAT: *Construction to begin soon*

Building
--------
cd into the repository `aimbat-docs`, and run:
````
  sphinx-build -b html . builddir
  make html
  make latexpdf
````

Remember to run these commands *before* you push to Github during each build!

It takes a while for the online docs to build and configure after you have pushed to Github.
